The members of this group project were Anna Gutowska, Krishna Patel, Nikita Sharma, and Abia Mallick. 

In this project, we all had EQUAL CONTRIBUTION!!!

All of us worked equally to complete this project. More specifically, we all worked on creating the login and logout pages of the project. Then, Abia and Nikita worked on the auctions(automatic and manual), bids, and all the alerts. Anna and Krishna worked on the browsing and advanced search functionalities, admin functions, and customer rep functions. We talked about each part together, what the part was asking, and the best way to implement those functions. There were parts when some of us struggled with the questions, but we had daily meetings in which we discussed any issues we were facing and worked together to find a solution.
